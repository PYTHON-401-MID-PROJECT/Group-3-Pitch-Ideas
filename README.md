# Project Title : Rubik Cube Solver (Second Idea )

## Summary of idea

This project allows users to play with a 3D Rubik's Cube with random input and focuses on AI by teaching our bot to detect a Rubik's Cube through input methods and provide a solution for the cube.

## The software seeks to solve the following problems?

- Rubik's Cube is a challenging game that improves memory and logical thinking. It requires a series of movement sequences or algorithms to be solved.
- The solver should match each side of the cube with squares of the same color.
- A Rubik's Cube consists of 26 small cubes that rotate on a central axis and nine colored cube faces, arranged in three rows of three on each side.
- When the cube is twisted out of its original arrangement, the player must return it to the original configuration, among 43 quintillion possible arrangements.

## Technologies Used1

- numpy
- ursina: game engine
- LITE SQL
- OpenCV
- Kociemba algorithm

## Features

- Create an interactive interface.
- Connect to a database to save the cube's state.
- Utilize the camera to capture photos of the cube.
- Use AI to build a model that can learn and teach how to solve the cube.

## What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

1. Users can interact with a 3D model of the Rubik's Cube, manipulating it with basic movements such as Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left, and Right.
2. The app can take input from the camera, recognize each side of the cube, and extract the colors of the squares along with their positions.
3. The app then provides the steps required to solve the cube.
